	Inconsistencies in trace.C, phasespace.C and spacetime.C eliminated 
	(not substantial) 

 	An exponential energy distribution function has been introduced in 
	domain.C

	Modification in include/matrix.h: include <iomanip.h> to compile with
	g++ (GCC) 3.2 20020903 (Red Hat Linux 8.0 3.2-7) and in 
	fresnel/include/parameter.h (double time_start instead of int)

	Another slight modification to utilities.C: the header iostream.h 
	(needed for cout and endl) is included now in order to enable 
	compiling with gcc 4 on Mac OS X 10.4
