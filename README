LPIC++ 1.3 SOURCE CODE DISTRIBUTION
===================================

  LPIC++ is a one-dimensional relativistic electromagnetic
  Particle-In-Cell (PIC) code for simulating the interaction 
  of laser light with plasma.
  You will find the complete documentation in pdf format in 
  directory 'lpic-*/doc/' after unpacking  LPIC++.
  LPIC++ is written in C++ and is supposed to run on any 
  Unix platform like Linux, Solaris, SunOS, AIX, etc. 
  It has been tested and used extensively under AIX.


DEPENDENCIES
============

  The parallelized version of LPIC++ requires one of the 
  following packages. If you want to run lpic as a single process
  only, you can ignore this section.

  - PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine), "a software system that 
    enables a collection of heterogeneous computers to be used 
    as a coherent and flexible concurrent computational resource". 
    Homepage:        http://www.csm.ornl.gov/pvm/pvm_home.html
    Download source: http://www.netlib.org/pvm3/index.html
    PVM's source code needs slight modifications in order to
    compile on Mac OS X. A modified package is available from
    http://hpc.sourceforge.net

  - LAM/MPI, an open-source implementation of the Message Passing
    Interface specification (www.mpi-forum.org).
    Homepage and Source: http://www.lam-mpi.org
    LAM/MPI is also available as binary Debian, rpm, Fink and 
    Apple Mac OS X packages. 

  LPIC++ was used from 1994 to 1997 under AIX with pvm3.2.6 and 
  pvm3.3.11.


INSTALL
=======

  1) Unpack the archive:

     Copy 'lpic-*.tar.gz' to the directory where you would like 
     to install LPIC++, change to this directory and type

       'gunzip lpic-*.tar.gz'
       'tar -xvf lpic-*.tar'

     Change to directory 'lpic-*'. 
     Installation is then done in three GNU steps:

  2) ./configure

     run "./configure --help" for options
     typical configurations:
       ./configure                                           
       ./configure --enable-pvm                         
       ./configure --enable-pvm \
                   --with-pvm-include=/usr/local/include \
                   --with-pvm-lib=/usr/local/lib

  3) make

  4) (sudo) make install-exec

  Installation has been tested so far on 
  - Mac OS X 10.3 and 10.4
  - Cygwin
  - Red Hat Linux 8.0 3.2-7


DISTRIBUTION
============

  Change to the pic directory and type "make dist".

     
USAGE AND DOCUMENTATION
=======================
